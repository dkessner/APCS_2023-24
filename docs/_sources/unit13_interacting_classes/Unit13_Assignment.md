# Unit 13 Assignment 

## Code exercises

Make sure to write test code (not necessarily full unit tests) to make sure
your functions are behaving properly.

### ShapeCollection

a. Write a Shape class, with private variables for name and number of sides,
constructor, and accessor functions.

b. Write a ShapeCollection class, which has a private ArrayList of Shape objects.
Include the following:

* a function to add a shape to the collection

* a function that takes a shape name as input, looks up the shape object by
  name, and returns the number of sides of the named shape: 

    ```    int numberOfSides(String shapeName)```

* a function that returns the average number of sides of the shapes in the collection

* a function that returns an ArrayList of the shapes with an even number of sides

### AcademicClass

a. Write a Student class, with private variables for name and favorite number
(integer), including constructor and accessor functions.

b) Write a Teacher class, with private variables for name and subject,
including constructor and accessor functions.
    
c) Write a class `AcademicClass`, representing a course you take in school.
The AcademicClass should have a private variable for the teacher, and a private
ArrayList of students.  Either include the teacher in the constructor or write
a setTeacher() function.  Also include the following:
        
* a function to add a student to the list

* a function that prints info about the class (i.e print the teacher and
  all student names.
   
* a function that takes a single integer `n` as input and returns an
  ArrayList of the names of the students whose favorite number is `n`

* a function that returns an ArrayList of the names of the students whose
  favorite number is odd
