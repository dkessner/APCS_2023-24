# Unit 6 Assignment


## Code

Write a program that animates something on screen.  Your program must
use an external class, with a `private PApplet` member variable that is
set via the constructor, and a `display()` function to draw the object. 

## Project

Decide on a project to start working on.  It can be any interactive
animation or video game.  You will be writing in Java, using the
Processing libraries.
