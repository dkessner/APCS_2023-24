## Install Java

```

Check that everything is installed properly.  These commands will report the
Java version.


```
java -version
javac -version
```


## Install Brackets

editor, feel free to use that instead.

```

## Paths

If you installed something but can't access it from the command line, you
probably need to adjust your ```PATH``` system environment variable.

Navigate to Control Panel (System Properties) / Advanced and click the
Environment Variables button.  Or search for "Edit the System Environment
Variables".
