## Code

Make sure to write full unit tests for these functions.

### Count lucky

A number is lucky if it is a multiple of 7 or ends in 7.  Write a function that
counts the number of lucky numbers in an array of integers.

```
countLucky({1, 2, 3}) -> 0
countLucky({7, 13, 17}) -> 2    
countLucky({107, 207}) -> 2    
```

### Sum of squares (array)

Write a function that takes a single array of doubles as input, and returns the
sum of squares of the values.

```
sumOfSquares({0}) -> 0
sumOfSquares({1.0, 2.0, 3.0}) -> 14.0
sumOfSquares({2.0, 2.0, 2.0}) -> 12.0
```

### Total Z name length

Write a function that takes an array of strings as input, and returns 
the total length of the strings that start with "z" or "Z".

```
countZNames({"Dr. Kessner", "Dr. Sands"}) -> 0
countZNames({"Zorro", "zero", "zippy"}) -> 14
```


## Project

It's time to start planning and prototyping your coding project!  

Your project can be any interactive animation or video game using the
Processing libraries.  

Your goals for the week:

* __Start your project!__  Make a folder, and get some code running, even if
  it's just a title screen and a bouncing ball.

* Make sure you understand how to use the Processing libraries in your program.
  In particular, you will need to understand how to write classes that call the
  Processing functions via a PApplet reference.

* Play around with some ideas.
