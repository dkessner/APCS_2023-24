# Class Info

__AP Computer Science A (APCS)__  
__2022-23__  
__Dr. Kessner__  
__Marlborough School, Los Angeles__  

## Topics

In this course we will dive deeply into object-oriented programming in the Java
language.  We will explore many programming and computer science concepts:

* data types and variables
* functions
* conditionals
* loops and algorithms
* logical and arithmetic operators
* arrays, ArrayLists
* computer graphics and animation
* classes and objects
* 2D arrays and image processing
* data analysis 
* algorithm analysis
* recursion


## Assignments and Grading

You will be given an assignment every week.  The assignment will include
readings and short coding tasks.

Each assignment has an associated quiz.  You can retake any quiz as many times
as you like.  However, in order to retake a quiz, you must first write up the
code from your original quiz, make sure it runs correctly, and show me.

You will also have at least one larger coding project, which you will present
at STEM + Arts Galleries and/or the Celebration of Innovation.

Your grade will be determined by your assignments, quizzes, and project(s)
(in roughly equal proportions).
