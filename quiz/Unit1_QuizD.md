```
This Fibonacci joke is as bad as the last two combined.
```

### 1. FizzSquared

Write code to print the first 30 squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...).  However, if
the original number (before squaring) is a multiple of 3, print "FizzSquared"
instead of the square.


```
public class FizzSquared
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

### 2. Arithmetic sequence


Write code to print out the first 20 terms of this arithmetic sequence:
5, -3, -11, -19, -27, ...


```
public class ArithmeticSequence
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```


\pagebreak


### 3. Duck duck goose!

Write code to print out each of the first 30 integers, followed by "duck".
However, if the integer is a multiple of 5, it should be followed by "goose"
instead.  And if it's a multiple of 10, it should be followed by "turkey".

Sample output:
```

1 duck
2 duck
3 duck
4 duck
5 goose
6 duck
7 duck
8 duck
9 duck
10 turkey
11 duck
...


public class DuckDuckGoose
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {






















    }
}
```
