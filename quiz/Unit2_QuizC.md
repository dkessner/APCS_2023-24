_Programmer's parent:_ Are you going to sit in front of that computer all day or
are you going to do your chores?

_Programmer_: Yes.


### 1. Double Fizzy 

Write a function that takes a single integer `n` as input.  If the number is
"fizzy", i.e. the number is divisible by 3 but not by 5, return double the
fizzy number.  Otherwise, return `n`.

```
int isFizzy(int n)
{














}
```

### 2. Three Friendly

Write a function that returns true if and only if the number is either 
divisible by 3, or the last digit is 3.


```
boolean isThreeFriendly(int n)
{














}
```



### 3.  Double Pairs

Write a function that, given 4 numbers `a, b, c, d`, returns true if and only
if the sum of the first two numbers is double the sum of the last two numbers.

For example:
```
doublePair(3, 3, 1, 2) -> true
doublePair(2, 2, 1, 1) -> true
doublePair(1, 1, 1, 1) -> false
doublePair(1, 2, 3, 4) -> false


boolean doublePair(int a, int b, int c, int d)
{
















}
```
