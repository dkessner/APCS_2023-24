### 1.  Negative sum

Write a function that returns the negative sum of the first `n` integers.

```
negativeSum(0) -> 0
negativeSum(1) -> -1
negativeSum(2) -> -1-2 = -3
negativeSum(3) -> -1-2-3 = -6
negativeSum(4) -> -1-2-3-4 = -10
negativeSum(5) -> -1-2-3-4-5 = -15
...
```

### 2. Lots of P

Write a function that counts the number of times that the letter 'p' or 'P'
occurs in a string, and returns `true` if there are more than 3 p's, `false`
otherwise.

For example:
```
lotsOfP("shampoo") -> false
lotsOfP("mississippi") -> false
lotsOfP("mississippi pigpen") -> true
lotsOfP("Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers.") -> true
```

### 3. Prefix Repeat

Write a function that takes a string and an integer `n` as input, and
returns a new string made from the first 3 letters repeated `n`
times.

For example:
```
prefixRepeat("012345678", 2) -> "012012"
prefixRepeat("abcdefghi", 3) -> "abcabcabc"
```
