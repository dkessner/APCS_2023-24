alternatingSum(2) -> 1-2 = -1
alternatingSum(3) -> 1-2+3 = 2
alternatingSum(4) -> 1-2+3-4 = -2
alternatingSum(5) -> 1-2+3-4+5 = 3

Write a function that takes a string as input, and returns the substring consisting
of the letters in fizzy positions, i.e. where the index is a multiple of 3.

For example:

fizzySubstring("012345678") -> "036"
fizzySubstring("abcdefghi") -> "adg"
fizzySubstring("AxxAxxAxx") -> "AAA"
```
