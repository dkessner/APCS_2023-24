```
This Fibonacci joke is as bad as the last two combined.
```

### 1. FizzFizz

Write code to print the first 30 positive integers.  However,
if the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
number, and if it's a multiple of 9, print "FizzFizz" instead.


```
public class FizzFizz
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

### 2. Geometric sequence


Write code to print out the first 30 terms of this geometric sequence:
5, 15, 45, 135, ...


```
public class GeometricSequence
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

\pagebreak


### 3. Fizzy buzz!

Write code to print out the first 30 multiples of 3.  However, if the integer
is also multiple of 5, print `FizzBuzz!` instead.

Sample output:
```
3
6
9
12
FizzBuzz!
18
21
24
27
FizzBuzz!

public class FizzyBuzz
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {






















    }
}
```
