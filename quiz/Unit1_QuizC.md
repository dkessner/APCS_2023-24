This Fibonacci joke is as bad as the last two combined.
```

### 1. Multiples of 8

Write code to print out all the multiples of 8 that are less than 50.

```
public class MultiplesOf8
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

### 2. Arithmetic sequence

Write code to print out the first 30 terms of this arithmetic sequence:
-3, 3, 9, 15, 21, ...


```
public class ArithmeticSequence
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

### 3. Yay!

Write code to print out the first 30 integers.  However, if the integer is a

5
Yay!
7
8
