_Programmer's parent:_ Are you going to sit in front of that computer all day or
are you going to do your chores?

_Programmer_: Yes.


### 1. Street Cleaning

Write a function that tells you if you will get a parking ticket.  You will get
a parking ticket if you park between 8:00 and 11:00 on Thursday (let Sunday = 0,
Monday = 1, etc.).


```
boolean parkedIllegally(float hour, int day)
{














}
```

### 2. Buzzy Numbers

Write a function that returns true if and only if the number is ``buzzy'', i.e.
the number is divisible by 5 but not by 3.



```
boolean isBuzzy(int n)
{














}
```



### 3. Increasing Sequence

Write a function that determines whether a sequence of 4 numbers 
$\{a, b, c, d\}$ is increasing, i.e. each term is at least as large
as the previous term.

For example:

```
isIncreasing(1, 2, 3, 4) -> true
isIncreasing(1, 1, 1, 1) -> true
isIncreasing(4, 3, 2, 1) -> false
isIncreasing(4, 3, 4, 4) -> false
```

```
boolean isIncreasing(int a, int b, int c, int d)
{
















}
```
