_Programmer's parent:_ Are you going to sit in front of that computer all day or
are you going to do your chores?

_Programmer_: Yes.


### 1. Highly Odd

Write a function that tells you if the two numbers are highly odd,
i.e. return true if and only if they are both odd numbers and larger than 99.

```
boolean highlyOdd(int a, int b)
{














}
```

### 2. Annoyed Neighbors

Write a function that returns true if your neighbors are annoyed at your loud
music.  Your neighbors are annoyed if 1) it is earlier than 6am or after 8pm
and 2) the volume is above 10.


```
boolean neighborsAnnoyed(int hour, int volume)
{














}
```



### 3. Arithmetic Sequence

Write a function that determines whether a sequence of 4 numbers 
$\{a, b, c, d\}$ is arithmetic, i.e. there is a common difference 
between the terms.

For example:
```
isArithmetic(1, 3, 5, 7) -> true
isArithmetic(3, 13, 23, 33) -> true
isArithmetic(1, 3, 5, 8) -> false
isArithmetic(1, 3, 9, 27) -> false
```

```
boolean isArithmetic(int a, int b, int c, int d)
{
















}
```
