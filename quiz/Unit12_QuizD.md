Why did the programmer stop dating the array?
Because he was one dimensional.

### 1. 2D Array Initialization

Write code to declare and initialize an array of integers with the following
values.  You must use a loop.

```
1000 1100 1200 1300
2000 2100 2200 2300
3000 3100 3200 3300
4000 4100 4200 4300
```

Write code to declare and initialize a 40x40 array of floats, with alternating
columns of 4's and 5's:

```
4 5 4 ...
4 5 4 ...
4 5 4 ...
4 5 4 ...
.
.
.
```

### 2. Extract large values

Write a function that takes a 2D array of floats as input and returns
an array list of the values that are greater than 100.

### 3. Shopping List

Suppose you are given the following interface:

```
public interface Item
{
    public String name();
    public double price();
}
```

Write a function that takes a 2D array of Item objects and returns the least
expensive Item object.  If the array is null or empty, return null.
