This Fibonacci joke is as bad as the last two combined.
```

### 1. Even numbers

Write code to print out all the even numbers less than 30.

```
public class EvenNumbers
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

### 2. Geometric sequence


Write code to print out the first 30 terms of this geometric sequence:
4, 8, 16, 32, ...


```
public class GeometricSequence
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {












    }
}
```

\pagebreak

### 3. Lucky odd!

Write code to print out the first 30 _odd_ integers.  However, if the integer
is a multiple of 9, print `Lucky!` instead.

Sample output:
```
1
3
5
7
Lucky!
11
...



public class LuckyOdd
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {






















    }
}
```
