What's the object-oriented way to become wealthy?
Inheritance.
```

### 1.  Shape Interface

Suppose you are given the Shape interface:

```
public interface Shape
{
    public float perimeter();
}
```

Write two concrete classes that implement the Shape interface, including
relevant private member variables, constructor, and Shape methods:

1) class Circle, which has a constructor taking a single float argument
representing the radius.

2) class Square, which has a constructor taking a single float argument
representing the side length.

### 2.  Big shapes

Write a function that takes an ArrayList of Shape objects as input and returns
a ArrayList of Shape objects whose perimeter is larger than 100.
